# capn_stuff
this repo supports the capn package in R.
This exercise pdf is designed for students with no experience in R, but who are familar with Fenichel et al. 2016 PNAS http://www.pnas.org/content/113/9/2382.short or with Addicott & Fenichel 2019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618302468

capN and groundwater exercise.pdf is the actual exercise, which may be used as a course problem set.
groundwater_capn.R is an R script students will need to do the problem set.
All else needed is pulled automatically from Github, so you will need an internet connection.

I have also put code here that enable you to remake Figure 4 from Fenichel and Abbott 2014 JAERE using the built in demo. The data to reproduce that figure are included inside the capn package.
